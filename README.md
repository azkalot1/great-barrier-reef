Detect crown-of-thorns starfish in underwater image data - kaggle competition.   
I didn't have much time to work on that competition, so this repo can be used as a template.   
It has an implementation for "mosaic augmentation" (combining several images together) and "copy and paste" (insert a bbox in the image) augmentations + tracking with neptune.ai
